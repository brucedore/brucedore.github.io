<p class="p1"> I am an Assistant Professor in Marketing at McGill University, and the research in my lab focuses on understanding how ideas, emotions, and behaviors spread. Current projects focus on predicting the success of persuasive messages using behavioral and brain data, with particular emphasis on understanding what makes health messaging effective. This work uses a multi-method approach that integrates methods from marketing, psychology, neuroscience, and computational social science. <span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
