<p class="p1">I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href = http://cn.asc.upenn.edu/ target='_blank' style="text-decoration: none"> Communication Neuroscience lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on the social and affective mechanisms that shape individual- and population-level behaviors. One line of my work examines psychological and neural mechanisms of persuasion and idea propagation. A second focuses on the social regulation of emotion and the processes of social influence that enable this regulation. A third pays specific attention to neural mechanisms of emotional reactivity and regulation. To test theoretically-derived hypotheses in these lines of work, I employ a multi-method approach that integrates methods from psychology, functional neuroimaging, and computational social science. <span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
