<p class="p1">I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href = http://cn.asc.upenn.edu/ target='_blank' style="text-decoration: none"> Communication Neuroscience lab</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on connections between emotion, communication, and health. To shed light on these topics, I use a combination of laboratory studies that examine psychological and neural mechanisms and large-scale field studies that capture how emotions unfold in natural contexts. In translational work, I apply this basic research toward the development of interventions aiming to improve mental and physical health. <span class="Apple-converted-space">Â </span></p>
